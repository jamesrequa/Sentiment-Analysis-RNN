# Recurrent Neural Network for Sentiment Analysis

This is a Recurrent Neural Network (i.e. RNN) for Sentiment Analysis. I am using a dataset containing IMDB reviews.

The network architecture consists of an embedded layer, LSTM cells, and sigmoid output layer. Built on TensorFlow, written in Python 3 and presented via Jupyter Notebook.
